            <div class="project-text-block">
              <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> In response to the global pandemic's urgent need for safe, pathogen-free environments, the primary challenge was to create a disinfection solution that was not only effective but fully autonomous.</p>
              <p><strong>My Leadership & Action:</strong> I led the entire product lifecycle, from initial concept to final integration. I personally developed the 2D/3D layouts in SolidWorks, created simulations in 3DS MAX, and handled the initial robot programming. Leading a team of one engineer and three technicians, I managed the project timeline and budget, coordinated with suppliers, and conducted field tests, ultimately securing client approval.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Technical Solution:</strong> A critical challenge was balancing the total weight, as the powerful UVC emitters required heavy batteries. A robust safety system, integrating multiple sensors, was engineered to ensure the environment was completely clear of personnel during disinfection cycles, a non-negotiable safety premise.</p>

            <div class="project-text-block">
              <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The client's production process was hampered by inefficiency and high maintenance costs due to frequent downtime in a highly contaminated environment. The goal was to engineer a more reliable and efficient curing solution.</p>
              <p><strong>My Leadership & Action:</strong> I initiated client contact to define requirements and architect the solution. I led the engineering team from design to commissioning, personally developing the 3D/2D models, electrical panel design, and PLC/HMI programming. The initial 2019 implementation was so successful that the client replicated the solution across two additional new production lines in 2020 and 2021. For these expansions, I managed the hardware and software integration of our proven system with the new lines supplied by a German equipment manufacturer.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Technical Solution:</strong> The process generated significant particulate residue that adhered to all components. My solution involved designing a custom, isolated atmosphere for the curing system, protecting it from the highly polluted environment and ensuring consistent operation.</p>

            <div class="project-text-block">
              <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The client faced a significant production bottleneck and material loss due to an inefficient flash-off process in their high-speed offset printing press.</p>
              <p><strong>My Leadership & Action:</strong> After analyzing the client's equipment, I created a physical mockup to validate the feasibility of fitting a solution into an extremely constrained physical space. Following approval, I developed the full 2D/3D project and managed one engineer through the equipment's execution.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Technical Solution:</strong> The core challenge was designing a system to operate within a 2mm tolerance of high-speed moving parts. This required developing a new, ultra-compact LED module housing and custom hydraulic connections to meet both the operational specifications and the severe space limitations.</p>

            <div class="project-text-block">
              <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The internal logistics for moving heavy loads required a safer and more efficient coupling system, eliminating manual steps and associated risks.</p>
              <p><strong>My Leadership & Action:</strong> I led the development of a custom hitch with an automatic locking mechanism. A key part of my role was to perform rigorous Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to validate the mechanical strength and guarantee the system could handle specified traction loads safely and reliably.</p>
              <p><strong>Key Technical Solution:</strong> The main challenge was designing a locking mechanism that was both mechanically simple for reliability and strong enough to withstand the significant, repetitive stresses of industrial use. The FEA simulations were crucial for optimizing the design for strength without adding unnecessary weight or complexity.</p>
